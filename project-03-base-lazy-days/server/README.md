# Lazy Days Spa Server

### A server for the "Lazy Days Spa" app in the Udemy course "React Query: Server State Management for React"

## Installing

1. Run `npm install`
2. `cp .env_template .env`
3. Optional, only necessary if you're going to deploy: update `.env` to contain your own secret string (can just mash the keyboard for a long random string)

## Starting the server

Run `npm start`. The server will be found at [http://localhost:3030]

# NOTE - use npm and not pnpm:
- please note the project-start files use `npm` and not `pnpm` so you should use npm for consistency with package-lock.json so that the intended version of packages are installed otherwise there are lots of errors.
